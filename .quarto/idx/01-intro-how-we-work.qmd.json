access to the shared drive, take a look at the Lab Meetings folder to find Lab Meeting Notes for each semester (previously called the Supercharge Plan) - GitHub - theMMElab is the shared GitHub account for the lab - lab-manual - This repository contains the lab manual, see section \\ref{#umassd-resources} for other useful resources and take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/thefaylab/lab-manual/wiki/Lab-Meeting-Schedule) to see the lab meeting schedule - lab-chat - This repository contains shared institutional knowledge for the Fay lab, take a look at Issue #22 for Zoom meeting links - Website - Take a look at the lab website, most of its information is duplicated in one of the above resources: <http://www.smast.umassd.edu/lab_fay/>\n\n##
