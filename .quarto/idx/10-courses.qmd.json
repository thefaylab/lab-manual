An exception is in the first year of study when students take 10 credits to meet the graduate seminar credit program requirement.  \n\nIn the Fay lab, we tend to take most (ALL?) of the quantitative courses on offer.  \n\nSeveral SMAST courses are offered on an alternating basis every 2 years. Particularly for MS students, you may want to take advantage of courses when they are offered, even if this means taking them out of the natural 'sequence'.   \n\n### Year 1 \n\nMost students take many of their core program requirements (denoted below with [C] or [PC] for policy core courses) in the first year. An exception may be PhD students who save one of the Oceanography requirements for the 2nd year, depending on other courses.  \n\n*Fall*\nMAR 540: Introduction to Fisheries Science (Stokesbury)  \nMAR 544: Stock Assessment of Fishery Resources (even years) (Cadrin)  \nMAR 555: Introduction to Physical Oceanography (Cowles/Sundermeyer)  [C]  \nMAR 700: Graduate Seminar (Fisheries Oceanography)  [C]  \n\n*Spring*\nMAR 545: Biological Oceanography (Turner) [C]  \nMAR 536: Biological Statistics II (Fay) (even years)  \nMAR 530: Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (odd years) (Fay)  [PC]  \nMAR 510: Chemical Oceanography [C]  \nMAR 700: Graduate Seminar (Fisheries Oceanography)  [C]  \n\nTypically, most remaining coursework is completed in years 2-3, but this will vary by individual. \n\n### Other courses Gavin will strongly 'suggest' you take\n\nMAR 580: Advanced Population Modeling (Fay) (odd years)  \n\n### Other courses you might want to take\n\n*Fall*\nMAR 525: US Ocean Policy (Pierce, fall even yrs)  [PC]  \nMAR 522: Science Communication for Research Scientists (Fay, fall)  \nMAR 599: Bayesian Statistics and Hierarchical Modeling (Fay, fall even yrs)  \nMAR 527: Fisheries Management (Cadrin, fall odd yrs)  \n*Spring*\nBIO XXX: Biological Statistics I (Kozak, spring)  \nMAR 622: Stock Identification Methods (Cadrin, spring even)  \n*Based on interest*\nMAR 5XX: Marine Resource Economics (Griffin & DePiper)  [PC]  \nMAR 580: Conservation in World Marine Capture Fisheries (He)  [PC]  \nMAR 580: Fish Behavior & Conservation Engineering (He)  \nMAR 580: Field Methods in Fisheries Research (Cadrin/Bethoney)  \n\n\nOf course there are lots of other course offerings - these are the ones that lab members have taken more than once. For present semester offerings, see the [SMAST website](https://www.umassd.edu/smast/academics/course-list/). Full list of current SMAST courses and for which courses meet IMS core course requirements can be found [here](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/smast_curriculum.html).  \n\n\n### Other UMassD courses \nCheck out course offerings in Data Science (DSC), Mathematics (MTH), Public Policy (POL), Biology (BIO), Mechanical Engeering (MNE), and Computer Science (CSI) in the Graduate Handbook and on COIN.    \nYou may find [this overview of the Data Science MS program](https://www.umassd.edu/data-science/graduate/requirements-ms/) and curriculum helpful in identifying other classes!\n\n### Courses outside of UMass Dartmouth\n\nSome IMS courses are offered at UMass Amherst, Boston, and Lowell.  \nInstructions and forms for registering for intercampus courses can be found under the 'Academics' section of the [SMAST Occupants](https://my.umassd.edu/group/smast-occupants) page.  \n\n\nJarrett Byrnes (UMass Boston) statistics & R courses   \n[Biol 607: An Introduction to Computational Data Analysis for Biology](https://byrneslab.net/teaching/biol-607/)\n[Introduction to Data Science for Biology](https://byrneslab.net/teaching/data_science/)  \n\n\nYou may also want to talk with Gavin about taking courses at another institution, say to take advantage of even more stock assessment and statistical computing courses (e.g. [Andre Punt's courses at University of Washington](http://puntlab.washington.edu/courses/).
