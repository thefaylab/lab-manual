This ~~bookdown~~ Quarto book is intended to be used for **incoming, current, and outgoing** members of the MME lab group. If we missed anything, please let Emma Rocke (emma.rocke@uct.ac.za) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!


__Want to adapt the lab manual for your group?__ This [short tutorial](https://github.com/thefaylab/lab-manual/wiki/Quick-steps-to-making-a-copy-of-the-lab-manual-&-publishing-it) steps through how to make your own copy of the lab manual repository and set it up so that it automatically publishes the book to the web (and updates as you make changes).
