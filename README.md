   :sparkles: Welcome to the Faylab Lab Manual! :sparkles: 
</p>


This ~~bookdown~~ Quarto book is intended to be used for **incoming, current, and outgoing** members of the Fay lab group. If we missed anything, please let Gavin Fay (gfay@umassd.edu) or Madeleine Guyant (mguyant@umassd.edu) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!


__Want to adapt the lab manual for your group?__ This [short tutorial](https://github.com/thefaylab/lab-manual/wiki/Quick-steps-to-making-a-copy-of-the-lab-manual-&-publishing-it) steps through how to make your own copy of the lab manual repository and set it up so that it automatically publishes the book to the web (and updates as you make changes).  

**Acknowledgements**

The content for this book was developed as part of our group’s participation in the Openscapes Champions program.
We are extremely grateful to and acknowledge [Dr. Julia Stewart Lowndes](https://github.com/jules32)’ role in helping shape how our lab both works and how we articulate our identity. 🙏
Thanks also to [Ileana Fenwick](https://github.com/IleanaF) and [Stefanie Butland](https://github.com/stefaniebutland) for their work moving the lab-manual from bookdown to Quarto. 🙌
